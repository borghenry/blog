title = "Seeking information or pressing for action: analysing the function of parliamentary questions in a comparative perspective"    
abstract = "In modern legislatures, political parties use parliamentary questions for two main purposes: to elicit information from the government and to press the government to pay attention to a specific issue. Although the literature agrees on the importance of both the information and agenda-setting functions, there is still little research on which of the two is prevalent and which conditions favour them. In particular, the differential strategy of majority and opposition parties deserves more attention: whereas opposition parties have strong incentives to exploit the conflict potential of parliamentary questions, majority MPs likely use these questions as an instrument to support the executive rather than as an attack tool. We study this matter by collecting comparable evidence on the policy content of parliamentary questions and Council of Ministersâ€™ meetings in two countries (Belgium and Portugal). One advantage of our study design is the possibility to test the reciprocal relationship between parliamentary questions and cabinet decisions, while controlling for attention in the media. Our preliminary findings suggest 1) that opposition parties do not tend to use parliamentary questioning to get the executive to release information immediately after a decision is taken, while Belgian majority parties do manage to divert attention away from issues recently decided upon by the executive; and 2) that parliamentary questions, from majority and opposition MPs alike, succeed respectively in anticipating and pushing issues into the cabinet agenda when also the media pay attention to them."
