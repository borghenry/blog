title = "The Five-Star Movement in Parliament: a Truly New Kind of Parliamentary Opposition?"    
abstract = "The Five-Star Movement embodies many characteristics of that 'new kind' of opposition which, according to authors such as Peter Mair, has been gaining ground in current parliamentary democracies in times of crisis. It is strongly anti-establishment, defies traditional cleavages and an identification with the classical left-right divide, and relies heavily on the new media to connect with its supporters on the ground. In the 2013 elections, they won representation for the first time in the Italian parliament, the heart of the institutions they criticise and aim to reform. At their first mandate and with a strong identification with the role of outsiders, the expectation is that their patterns of issue attention in Parliament ought to differ substantially from that of other opposition parties. This paper tackles this question by analysing the policy content of three types of activities (bills, written and oral parliamentary questions) carried out during the first two cabinets in the XVII legislature (February 2013 - November 2016). It aims at answering two questions: did the agenda of the 5SM differ from that of other opposition groups? is the 5SM leading other party agendas or mainly reacting to it?"
