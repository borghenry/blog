title = "Constituency Characteristics, Expertise, Civil Society Links and Parliamentary Questions: Evidence from Portugal"
abstract = "What determines the topic selected by MPs for their parliamentary questions in a non-preferential electoral system? This paper aims to contribute to current studies on parliamentary questions and political representation by examining the impact of three individual-level explanatory factors of topic selection: characteristics of electoral districts, expertise and personal characteristics of the MP. The institutional characteristics of the Portuguese political system represent a suitable case study to evaluate our hypotheses. Portuguese MPs have a national mandate and their re-election chances hinge on being reselected by the party elites (closed list PR with centralized candidate selection mainly by national party elites). This should make the odds of observing a direct link to their constituencies and a significant impact of personal characteristics lower in comparison with preferential systems. The paper tackles this question by drawing on a dataset comprising the population of parliamentary questions (more than 14,000) tabled by Portuguese MPs in the period from 2009 until 2015."
