title = "The issue strategies of niche parties between elections: an analysis of question time in six countries"      
abstract = "The role of niche parties in issue competition has recently been granted increasing scholarly attention and a debate is under way on how to define them in opposition to mainstream parties. Most of the works on the subject focus on electoral competition and use the content of programmatic platforms as their empirical base. Although elections remain focal points for party competition, they represent only one arena where issue competition takes place. This paper sets out to explore the strategies of issue emphasis implemented by niche parties in the course of the electoral mandate by analysing the kind of topics they address in their oral questions to the government. It analyses whether, in comparison with mainstream parties, niche partiesâ€™ issue profile in parliamentary questioning is more congruent with their electoral manifesto priorities and less likely to be affected by the issue profile of their competitors. The paper builds on a data set providing information on the issue content of oral questions in six European countries (Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal) created using the Comparative Agendas Project coding protocol."
